## üêç Python Projects 

[**Financial Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices with TensorFlow and Visualization**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/FIN_TIME_SERIES_TENSORFLOW_VIZ)

#### Tools:
- Python (core language)
- TensorFlow / Keras ‚Äì Deep learning framework for building and training time series forecasting models.
- NumPy / Pandas ‚Äì Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn ‚Äì Exploratory data visualization.
- Scikit-learn ‚Äì Scaling, splitting data, and evaluation metrics.

#### Keynotes:
- Implemented time series preprocessing: normalization, train/test splits, and sequence generation.
- Built deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, RNN, or GRU) to capture sequential dependencies.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
- Visualized training history, predicted vs. actual prices, and future forecast trends.
- Highlighted strengths and limitations of deep learning in financial forecasting.




[**Bitcoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning and Visualization**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-ML)

#### Tools:
- Python (primary workflow used in this project)
- Pandas / NumPy ‚Äì Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Scikit-learn ‚Äì Linear Regression, Random Forest, scaling, and evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn ‚Äì Data visualization (predictions, residuals, feature importance, heatmaps).

#### Keynotes:
- Created target variable (next-day closing price) for supervised learning.
- Engineered financial indicators:
  - MA7 and MA14 (moving averages)
  - Volatility (7-day standard deviation)
  - Lag features (previous day‚Äôs closing price)

- Trained and tested models on historical Bitcoin data:
  - Linear Regression achieved strong performance with low error and high R¬≤.
  - Random Forest performed poorly, showing signs of overfitting and instability.

- Visualized results with:
  - Predicted vs. actual Bitcoin prices.
  - Residual error distributions.
  - Feature importance scores (Random Forest).
  - Correlation heatmap of features vs. target.

#### Tools: 

#### Keynotes: 


[**Payments Fraud Detection**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Payments_Fraud_Detection)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

#### Keynotes: 



[**Python Image Processing Script for Geospatial Data**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/PyScript-Image-Processing-GeoData)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (xarray, matplotlib, numpy, netCDF4)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Gathered NetCDF4 files (scientific data) and was imaged processed by using Python and its libraries. 

‚Ä¢	Numpy was utilized for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

‚Ä¢	Matplotlib was used for 3D visualization and plots to have a display of the radargram. 

‚Ä¢	NetCDF4 which allows you to read and write NetCDF files in Python.

‚Ä¢	Xarray for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.

[**COVID-19 and Unemployment Rate Analytics**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/COVID-19-UER-Analytics)

#### Tools: Excel, Python Libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢ Cleaned and structured 141 monthly observations from .xlsx format.

‚Ä¢ Filtered and segmented data by country to track timeline-specific trends.

‚Ä¢ Used Plotly and Seaborn to build both interactive and static charts.

‚Ä¢ Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify relationships.

‚Ä¢ Identified weak to moderate correlations between COVID-19 surges and labor market fluctations.

‚Ä¢ Clearly communicated insights using well-annotated graphs and written interpretation.

## üîí Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Projects

 [**SIEM Simulation with Microsoft Azure + Honeypot**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-Simulation-with-Microsoft-Azure)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services (Resource group, Log Analytics Workspace, Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Network security group)

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Virtual Machine will act as a honeypot allowing all unsecure ports open for incoming traffic.

‚Ä¢	Firewall configurations were made through connection via RDP for allowing all unsecure ports.

‚Ä¢	Created Microsoft Sentinel workspace and installed Data Connectors (Security Events via Legacy Agent and Windows Security Events via AMA).

‚Ä¢	Created a Log Analytics workspace and a data collection rule to forward logs.

‚Ä¢	Kusto Query Language (KQL) was utilized to view Security Events using parameters/filters.

‚Ä¢	GeoIP Data was utilized to display a Live-Attack map to view incoming/outcoming traffic.


[**SIEM, Network Forensics, & Incident Response Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-NF-IR-Home-Lab)

##### Tools: VmWare Workstation Pro17, Ubuntu, REMNux, Cloudflare, Splunk

##### Keynotes: 

‚Ä¢ Created an isolated environment to analyze security incidents and malware.

‚Ä¢ Configured Splunk on Ubuntu to analyze security incidents utilizing sample data from Splunk BOSS of the SOC (version 3).

‚Ä¢ Setup Remnux and utilized the tool for malware analysis to analyze malicious software.

‚Ä¢ Configured Cloudflare on Windows 11 to conduct network forensics and monitoring.

## üóÑÔ∏è Windows Active Directory Projects

[**Active Directory Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Active-Directory-Home-Lab)

##### Tools: VMWare Workstation Pro 17, PowerShell, Windows 11, Windows Server 2022

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Configured Windows Server 2022 as the Domain Controller (DC) for the two NICs (Internet and Internal). 

‚Ä¢	Utilized different services (Active Directory Domain Services, Remote Access Server, DHCP Server, DNS). 

‚Ä¢	Created a domain and admin account to administer 1000+ users (Users were created using a PowerShell script).
