## üêç Python Projects 

[**Python Image Processing Script for Geospatial Data**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/PyScript-Image-Processing-GeoData)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (xarray, matplotlib, numpy, netCDF4)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢ Created an APA formatted research paper called Data Collection of Radargrams and Image Processing using Python.

‚Ä¢ Will only provide script for the Geospatial Data as I did other tasks that were being assigned by the organization.

‚Ä¢	Gathered NetCDF4 files (scientific data) and was imaged processed by using Python and its libraries. 

‚Ä¢	Numpy was utilized for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

‚Ä¢	Matplotlib was used for 3D visualization and plots to have a display of the radargram. 

‚Ä¢	NetCDF4 which allows you to read and write NetCDF files in Python.

‚Ä¢	Xarray for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.

[**COVID-19 and Unemployment Rate Analytics**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/COVID-19-UER-Analytics)

#### Tools: Excel, Python Libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢ Cleaned and structured 141 monthly observations from .xlsx format.

‚Ä¢ Filtered and segmented data by country to track timeline-specific trends.

‚Ä¢ Used Plotly and Seaborn to build both interactive and static charts.

‚Ä¢ Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify relationships.

‚Ä¢ Identified weak to moderate correlations between COVID-19 surges and labor market fluctations.

‚Ä¢ Clearly communicated insights using well-annotated graphs and written interpretation.


[**Network Security Docker Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Net-Sec-Docker-Lab)
