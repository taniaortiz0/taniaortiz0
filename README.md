## üîí Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Projects

 [**SIEM Simulation with Microsoft Azure + Honeypot**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-Simulation-with-Microsoft-Azure)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services (Resource group, Log Analytics Workspace, Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Network security group)

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Virtual Machine will act as a honeypot allowing all unsecure ports open for incoming traffic.

‚Ä¢	Firewall configurations were made through connection via RDP for allowing all unsecure ports.

‚Ä¢	Created Microsoft Sentinel workspace and installed Data Connectors (Security Events via Legacy Agent and Windows Security Events via AMA).

‚Ä¢	Created a Log Analytics workspace and a data collection rule to forward logs.

‚Ä¢	Kusto Query Language (KQL) was utilized to view Security Events using parameters/filters.

‚Ä¢	GeoIP Data was utilized to display a Live-Attack map to view incoming/outcoming traffic.

[**Vulnerability Management using Nessus (Tenable) + Scan and Fix Vulnerabilities**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Vulnerability-Management-using-Nessus)
