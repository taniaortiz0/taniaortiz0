## üîí Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Projects

 [**SIEM Simulation with Microsoft Azure + Honeypot**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-Simulation-with-Microsoft-Azure)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services (Resource group, Log Analytics Workspace, Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Network security group)

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Virtual Machine will act as a honeypot allowing all unsecure ports open for incoming traffic.

‚Ä¢	Firewall configurations were made through connection via RDP for allowing all unsecure ports.

‚Ä¢	Created Microsoft Sentinel workspace and installed Data Connectors (Security Events via Legacy Agent and Windows Security Events via AMA).

‚Ä¢	Created a Log Analytics workspace and a data collection rule to forward logs.

‚Ä¢	Kusto Query Language (KQL) was utilized to view Security Events using parameters/filters.

‚Ä¢	GeoIP Data was utilized to display a Live-Attack map to view incoming/outcoming traffic.

[**Vulnerability Management using Nessus (Tenable) + Scan and Fix Vulnerabilities**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Vulnerability-Management-using-Nessus)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services, Nessus Vulnerability Management Software, Windows 11

##### Keynotes: 



[**SIEM, Network Forensics, & Incident Response Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-NF-IR-Home-Lab)

##### Tools: VmWare Workstation Pro17, Ubuntu, REMNux, Cloudflare, Splunk

##### Keynotes: 

‚Ä¢ Created an isolated environment to analyze security incidents and malware.

‚Ä¢ Configured Splunk on Ubuntu to analyze security incidents utilizing sample data from Splunk BOSS of the SOC (version 3).

‚Ä¢ Setup Remnux and utilized the tool for malware analysis to analyze malicious software.

‚Ä¢ Configured Cloudflare on Windows 11 to conduct network forensics and monitoring.

## üêç Python Projects 

[**Python Image Processing Script for Geospatial Data**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/PyScript-Image-Processing-GeoData)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (xarray, matplotlib, numpy, netCDF4)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢ Created a 45-page APA formatted research paper called Data Collection of Radargrams and Image Processing using Python.

‚Ä¢ The APA formatted research paper contains radar stratigraphy and glaciology terminology, literature reviews, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, references, and an appendix.

‚Ä¢	Gathered NetCDF4 files (scientific data) and was imaged processed by using Python and its libraries. 

‚Ä¢	Numpy was utilized for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

‚Ä¢	Matplotlib was used for 3D visualization and plots to have a display of the radargram. 

‚Ä¢	NetCDF4 which allows you to read and write NetCDF files in Python.

‚Ä¢	Xarray for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.

[**COVID-19 and Unemployment Rate Analytics**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/COVID-19-UER-Analytics)

#### Tools: Excel, Python Libraries (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢ Cleaned and structured 141 monthly observations from .xlsx format.

‚Ä¢ Filtered and segmented data by country to track timeline-specific trends.

‚Ä¢ Used Plotly and Seaborn to build both interactive and static charts.

‚Ä¢ Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify relationships.

‚Ä¢ Identified weak to moderate correlations between COVID-19 surges and labor market fluctations.
