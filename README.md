## üîí Cybersecurity & SOC Analyst Projects

 [**SIEM Simulation with Microsoft Azure + Honeypot**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/SIEM-Simulation-with-Microsoft-Azure)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services (Resource group, Log Analytics Workspace, Windows 10 VM, Virtual network, Network security group)

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Virtual Machine will act as a honeypot allowing all unsecure ports open for incoming traffic.

‚Ä¢	Firewall configurations were made through connection via RDP for allowing all unsecure ports.

‚Ä¢	Created Microsoft Sentinel workspace and installed Data Connectors (Security Events via Legacy Agent and Windows Security Events via AMA).

‚Ä¢	Created a Log Analytics workspace and a data collection rule to forward logs.

‚Ä¢	Kusto Query Language (KQL) was utilized to view Security Events using parameters/filters.

‚Ä¢	GeoIP Data was utilized to display a Live-Attack map to view incoming/outcoming traffic.

[**Vulnerability Management using Nessus (Tenable) + Scan and Fix Vulnerabilities**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/Vulnerability-Management-using-Nessus)

##### Tools: Microsoft Azure Services, Nessus Vulnerability Management Software, Windows 11

## üóÑÔ∏è Windows Active Directory Projects

[**Active Directory Home Lab**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/AD-GPM-with-PowerShell-Automation)

##### Tools: VMWare Workstation Pro 17, PowerShell, Windows 11, Windows Server 2022

##### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Configured Windows Server 2022 as the Domain Controller (DC) for the two NICs (Internet and Internal). 

‚Ä¢	Utilized different services (Active Directory Domain Services, Remote Access Server, DHCP Server, DNS). 

‚Ä¢	Created a domain and admin account to administer 1000+ users (Users were created using a PowerShell script).

‚Ä¢	Configured Windows 11 as the Client to act as a private-internal network through DC.

[**Active Directory Corporate Network Simulation**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/AD-Corp-Net-Simulation)

#### Tools: OpenDNS, OpenVPN Access Server & Services, Oracle VirtualBox, OpenSSH Server (SFTP), Windows Defender Firewall, Windows 11, Windows Server 2022

#### Keynotes:

- In continuation of the Active Directory Home Lab

## üêç Python Projects 

[**Python Script to Image Process Geophysical Data**](https://github.com/taniaortiz0/PyScript-Image-Processing-GeoData)

#### Tools: Python Libraries (xarray, matplotlib, numpy, netCDF4)

#### Keynotes:

‚Ä¢	Gathered NetCDF4 file (scientific data) and were imaged processed by using Python and its libraries. 

‚Ä¢	Numpy was utilized for numerical computing with arrays and matrices.

‚Ä¢	Matplotlib was used for 3D visualization and plots to have a display of the radargram. 

‚Ä¢	NetCDF4 which allows you to read and write NetCDF files in Python.

‚Ä¢	Xarray for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.
